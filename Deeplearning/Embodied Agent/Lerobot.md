# Intro
LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.
It is deeply connected with huggingface community, LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on this Hugging Face community page:Â [huggingface.co/lerobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot)
